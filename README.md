##Game Rules

The Thing: A hidden traitor game for 5 players
Overview
It is the start of the bleak, desolate winter for researchers manning a claustrophobic, isolated Antarctic outpost when they come into contact with a hostile extraterrestrial lifeform. Bent on assimilating Earth's native species, this being infiltrates the facility â€” creating a perfect imitation of one of the crew. The staff frantically begin trying to narrow down who is human, and who is not, desperate to purge this alien infection before it can successfully imitate the full team.
And escape

The Game
Each player will be assigned a party: Human or Alien.

The goal of the humans is to block 5 imitation attempts by The Thing or it's alien accomplice.
Do this by playing imitation blocked cards to the board.

The goal of the aliens, which is made up of the alien leader, The Thing, and at least one accomplice, is to remain hidden long enough to successfully imitate 5 times.
Do this by playing imitation passed cards to the board.

Each Round
A Captain will be assigned. They will choose a Co-Captain.
The Captain will draw a hand of 3 cards made of Imitation Blocked and Imitation Passed cards.
They will discard one and pass the remaining two to the Co-Captain who will choose a card to play to the board

If The Thing is chosen as Co-Captain after 4 Imitation Successful cards have been played to the board;
the aliens automatically win.
