              It is the start of the bleak, desolate winter for researchers
              manning a claustrophobic, isolated Antarctic outpost when they
              come into contact with a hostile extraterrestrial lifeform. Bent
              on assimilating Earth's native species, this being infiltrates the
              facility â€” creating a perfect imitation of one of the crew. The
              staff frantically begin trying to narrow down who is human, and
              who is not, desperate to purge this alien infection before it can
              successfully imitate the full team.
